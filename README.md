# Weather Station

**This repository contains code for a simple weather station with an outdoor module. The indoor module displays the temperature, humidity and pressure measured by both the indoor and the outdoor module. Both modules are Arduino-based and use a combinded AHT20 + BMP280 sensor. The indoor module utilizes an LCD to display measured values.**
