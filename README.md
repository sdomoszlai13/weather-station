# Weather Station

**This repository contains code for a simple weather station with an outdoor module. The indoor module displays the temperature, humidity and pressure measured by both the indoor and the outdoor module. Both modules are Arduino-based and use a combinded AHT20 + BMP280 sensor. The indoor module utilizes an LCD to display measured values.**

The weatche station consists of a module that can be placed in your house and an outdoor module that you can place outside. The modules take measurement every minute. The outdoor module sends the measured values to the base station that displays both inside and outside temperatures, humidities and pressures.
